      "['For nine consecutive days, that is from around April 27 to May 6, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF)  and the RSF have exchanged artillery shelling,  using Katyusha rockets and various shells, in Babanusa, West Kordofan. The fighting further destroyed the city that many residents had already left.\\nAccording to sources consulted by Sudan War Monitor, the SAF were inside the 22nd Infantry Division base, the last military installation of the Sudan Army’s control in West Kordofan, while the RSF troops fought from the outskirts of the city, sheltering  in residents’ homes and under trees to avoid aircraft bombardment. According to the Sudan War Monitor’s sources, the bombing damaged many civilians’ homes in which RSF fighters were sheltering. The neighborhoods of Al-Salam South, Al-Tarbiyah, Abu Ismail South, Al-Sahafa East, Al-Sahafa West, and the Babanusa Dairy Factory neighborhood were those where homes were most completely and partially damaged. In addition, government institutions and facilities, such as the buildings of the Sudan Railway Authority (Western Region Headquarters), some schools, and water sources were also damaged.\\nOn May 3rd, according to information received from the Babanusa Emergency Room, four members of the same family were killed as a result of the  violent artillery shelling carried out by the RSF on the Sudan Armed Forces who control the 22nd Infantry Division Headquarters. The family had sought refuge in the 22nd Infantry Division. As a reminder, Babanusa has been the theater of several violent clashes between the RSF and the Sudanese Army since 2023.According to the same sources the shelling also, injured or killed a large number of livestock as well as fighters on both the RSF and SAF sides. At least, three RSF fighters and two Army soldiers of the Artillery Corps were killed. So, in total, besides the destruction of homes, there were at least  5 combattants and 4 civilians killed.']\n"

      "['2024 News. For nine consecutive days, that is from around April 27 to May 6, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF)  and the RSF have exchanged artillery shelling,  using Katyusha rockets and various shells, in Babanusa, West Kordofan. The fighting further destroyed the city that many residents had already left.\\nAccording to sources consulted by Sudan War Monitor, the SAF were inside the 22nd Infantry Division base, the last military installation of the Sudan Army’s control in West Kordofan, while the RSF troops fought from the outskirts of the city, sheltering  in residents’ homes and under trees to avoid aircraft bombardment. According to the Sudan War Monitor’s sources, the bombing damaged many civilians’ homes in which RSF fighters were sheltering. The neighborhoods of Al-Salam South, Al-Tarbiyah, Abu Ismail South, Al-Sahafa East, Al-Sahafa West, and the Babanusa Dairy Factory neighborhood were those where homes were most completely and partially damaged. In addition, government institutions and facilities, such as the buildings of the Sudan Railway Authority (Western Region Headquarters), some schools, and water sources were also damaged.\\nAccording to the same sources the shelling also, injured or killed a large number of livestock as well as fighters on both the RSF and SAF sides. At least, three RSF fighters and two Army soldiers of the Artillery Corps were killed. So, in total, besides the destruction of homes, there were at least  5 combattants and 4 civilians killed.']\n"

In West Darfur, farmers whose lands were plundered by the RSF have eaten the seeds they bought for planting because they have run out of food. In the Kordofan region, people have sold their furniture and clothes to get cash for food. In Khartoum, residents under siege in their homes have picked the leaves off trees and boiled and eaten them.\" In a report published on May 3rd, Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) also warned: \"The assessment of a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) warrants great alarm at the same time as underscoring the severity of acute food insecurity anticipated in Sudan under FEWS NET’s most likely scenario. In the most likely scenario, levels of\\nhunger and malnutrition are expected to reach Emergency (IPC Phase 4) with some households in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5), and humanitarian food assistance needs will rise sharply through the lean season.\" The food shortages are caused by the escalating violence that forcibly displaced millions of people, made farming impossible, and blocked aid delivery, especially in El Fasher that used to be the hub for humanitarian assistance.']\n"
